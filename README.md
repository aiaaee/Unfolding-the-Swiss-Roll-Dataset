This project explores the **Swiss Roll dataset**, a classical benchmark in machine learning used to study **clustering** and **manifold learning** methods.  
The aim is to compare traditional clustering algorithms (such as K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models) with modern manifold learning approaches (such as Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding, MDS, and t-SNE) in order to understand their strengths and limitations.  


## Introduction 

The **Swiss Roll** dataset is a synthetic 3D dataset commonly used to test algorithms in:  
- **Clustering**  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
- **Manifold Learning**  

Its nonlinear, rolled-up structure makes it an excellent test case: simple clustering often fails to capture the underlying geometry, while manifold learning techniques can "unfold" the dataset into a meaningful 2D representation.
