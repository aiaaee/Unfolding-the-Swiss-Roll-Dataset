## Description
Unfolding the Swiss Roll Dataset explores different approaches to analyzing and visualizing the famous Swiss Roll dataset — a classic benchmark in machine learning for studying clustering and manifold learning methods.


In this project:

1.Apply K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to perform clustering in the original 3D space.

2.Highlight the limitations of conventional clustering algorithms when dealing with nonlinear manifolds.

3.Use Isomap, a manifold learning technique, to “unfold” the Swiss Roll into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving its intrinsic geometry.

4.Compare the outcomes of clustering-based and manifold-based methods, showing how manifold learning provides a more meaningful representation of the data.

This project demonstrates the contrast between traditional clustering algorithms and manifold learning techniques, providing an intuitive visualization of how nonlinear structures in data can be better understood through dimensionality reduction.
